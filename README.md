### **THE SEATTLE DIET**

*(Inspired by "The Mediterranean Diet")*

***An Automated Nutrition Architecture Based on Pareto Optimality***

**Objective:** Extremely low cost (under $250/month), extremely low effort (under 10 minutes/day), and an extremely healthy system (ranking in the 99th percentile or higher).

**Designer:** Yiyang Liu

**Target User:** A ~30-year-old Senior Software Engineer in Seattle, pursuing ultimate efficiency and health.

**Core Design Philosophy:** Modular, Scalable, High-Efficiency, Cost-Controlled, Data-Driven, Flavor-Customizable, and Extremely Lazy-Friendly.

---
## Layer 1: The Foundation
*The Physical Substrate for Macro and Micronutrients*

### 1.1 Carbohydrate Base
**Core Formula:** A Compound Carbohydrate Matrix of high-quality short-grain rice + steel-cut oats.
- **Carb A: Japanese Koshihikari Rice (Tamaki Gold/Uonuma)**
  - **Selection Rationale:** Utilizes California-grown Japanese Koshihikari or Niigata Uonuma-grown Koshihikari, which have low amylose content ($<20\%$). This results in a soft, sticky, and springy texture with a Glycemic Index (GI) 15-20% lower than ordinary long-grain rice, providing a steady and stable supply of glucose to the brain.
  - **Ratio:** 3 cups of dry rice (~450g) per batch.
  - **Cooking Vessel:** Zojirushi NP-HCC18XH IH Rice Cooker, which uses Induction Heating (IH) technology for 360° uniform heating, unlocking the deep aroma of the rice grains.

- **Carb B: Bob's Red Mill Steel Cut Oats**
  - **Selection Rationale:** Also known as Pinhead Oats, these are unrolled and retain the complete bran and germ. Their beta-glucan content is 40% higher than instant oats, providing over 7g of soluble dietary fiber daily, which slows gastric emptying and increases satiety.
  - **Ratio:** 2 cups of dry oats (~300g) cooked together with the rice to form a "Fast Carb + Slow Carb" blood sugar buffering system.
  - **Synergistic Effect:** The viscous proteins from the oats bind with the rice starch. Upon cooling, this can form Resistant Starch, which is beneficial for gut flora fermentation to produce butyrate.

*   **Implementation Strategy:** Mix rice and steel-cut oats at an approximate 1:1 ratio and cook using a high-end `Zojirushi` IH rice cooker.
*   **System Advantages:**
    *   **Dual Energy-Release Curve:** The rice provides quickly absorbed glucose for immediate energy, while the steel-cut oats, as a low-GI food, offer a slow, sustained energy release. This prevents sharp blood sugar spikes and helps maintain stable energy and focus for long periods, perfectly suiting a software engineer's workflow.
    *   **Dietary Fiber Guarantee:** Steel-cut oats are rich in beta-glucan, a powerful soluble fiber that enhances satiety, supports gut health, and helps stabilize cholesterol levels, effectively compensating for the lack of fiber in refined white rice.
    *   **Taste and Satisfaction:** Premium Japanese rice provides an exceptional taste and aroma, ensuring dietary pleasure, while the steel-cut oats add a chewy, "Q-texture," creating a more complex mouthfeel.

**Monthly Consumption:** Approx. 7.5 lbs rice + 7.5 lbs oats ($20.50 + $17.05)

### 1.2 Protein Rotation System
**Ternary Protein Matrix:** Eggs (liquid state) + Poultry (solid state) + Deep-sea Fish (canned), covering the full amino acid spectrum and micronutrient variations.

- **Source A: Eggs**
  - **Specification:** Lucerne Farms Cage Free Large (or upgrade to Vital Farms Pasture-Raised).
  - **Intake:** 10 per day (4 whole eggs + 6 egg whites), providing ~40g of protein, 1.6g of lecithin, and ~550mg of Choline.
  - **Safety:** Steam-cooked upright in a Dash Rapid Egg Cooker (7-egg capacity) to prevent shell-borne Salmonella from contaminating the rice; always hard-boiled.

- **Source B: Chicken Drumsticks, Thighs**
  - **Pre-processing:** Purchase pre-seasoned raw chicken thighs (e.g., California Garlic Medley or Grillmaster Seasoning), batch-roast in the oven (425°F/220°C for 35-40 minutes), and then freeze.
  - **Storage:** Vacuum-seal after cooking and store in the freezer (-18°C) for 2-3 months.
  - **Intake:** On days alternating with eggs, 2-3 pieces per day (~200-250g), providing 40-50g of protein and a natural source of Creatine.

- **Source C: Wild Sardines**
  - **Selection:** Wild Planet Wild Sardines in Water (No Salt Added), 4.4oz can. As primary predators, they have no significant heavy metal bioaccumulation (mercury content <0.01ppm).
  - **Nutrition:** Each can provides 18g of protein, 1,800mg of EPA/DHA Omega-3s, and 70% DV of Vitamin D.
  - **Rotation:** As the third option to eggs and chicken, consume 2-3 cans per week, either directly from the can or mixed with rice.

*   **Implementation Strategy:** Employ a **Rotation Strategy**, switching between the three primary sources (chicken, sardines, eggs) to ensure nutritional diversity.
*   **System Advantages:**
    *   **Complete Amino Acid Profile:** All three sources are complete proteins, providing all essential amino acids to support muscle repair and various physiological functions.
    *   **Nutritional Complementarity:**
        *   **Chicken thighs** offer rich iron, zinc, and B vitamins, and contain more healthy fats and flavor than chicken breast.
        *   **Sardines** are a top-tier natural source of Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA), Vitamin D, and calcium (if eaten with bones), with a very low risk of heavy metal contamination as they are low on the food chain.
        *   **Eggs** are hailed as a "perfect food," with the yolk being an excellent source of choline, vitamins A, D, E, K, as well as lutein and zeaxanthin.
    *   **Risk Hedging:** The rotation strategy mitigates potential risks associated with long-term consumption of a single protein source (e.g., accumulation of specific contaminants or nutrient imbalances).

**Monthly Cost:** Eggs $21.40 + Chicken $19.90 + Sardines $28.71 = ~$70

### 1.3 Lipid Profile
**Layered Lipid Architecture:** Cooking Oil (stable) + Finishing Oil (aromatic) + Supplement (functional).

- **Base Cooking Oil:** Graza Sizzle Extra Virgin Olive Oil (16.9-33.8 fl oz)
  - **Characteristics:** A high-polyphenol, peak-harvest EVOO with a smoke point of 410°F. Used for drizzling on rice (1 tbsp, ~15ml per meal).
  - **Function:** Comprises 73% Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA), promoting the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (D3/K2).

- **Aromatic Finishing Oil:** Kadoya Roasted Sesame Oil (11 fl oz)
  - **Usage:** A final drizzle of 3-5 drops provides a nutty aroma and a "hot pot dipping oil illusion," triggering retro-nasal olfaction.

- **Functional Lipids:** Sports Research Omega-3 Fish Oil (from Alaska Pollock)
  - **Dosage:** 1 softgel daily (1250mg), providing 690mg EPA + 260mg DHA. IFOS 5-star certified, in triglyceride (TG) form, which has a 40% higher absorption rate than the ethyl ester (EE) form.

*   **Implementation Strategy:** Drizzle a spoonful of `Graza "Drizzle"` over rice after cooking, take a fish oil capsule, and obtain natural fats from the protein sources.
*   **System Advantages:**
    *   **Golden Fatty Acid Ratio:** The system is centered around **monounsaturated fats** rich in antioxidant polyphenols (olive oil), strategically supplemented with crucial **polyunsaturated Omega-3s** (fish oil, sardines), while strictly limiting unhealthy saturated and trans fats.
    *   **Clear Functions:** `Graza "Sizzle"` for potential cooking (like roasting chicken), `Graza "Drizzle"` for finishing and flavor, and fish oil capsules for precise EPA/DHA supplementation. This clear division of labor reflects an engineer's precision.

**Monthly Cost:** Graza $18 + Kadoya $11 + Fish Oil $9.32 = ~$38

### 1.4 Phytonutrients & Fiber System
**The Freezing Strategy:** Nutrient Lock-in + Indefinite Shelf Life + Microwave-Ready.

- **Cruciferous Vegetables:** Signature SELECT Broccoli Florets (32oz family pack)
  - **Processing:** Microwave directly from frozen for 3 minutes in a paper-based container (using steam-in-bag tech or a covered container) to preserve glucoraphanin.
  - **Dosage:** 3.2oz (~90g) daily, providing 80mg of Vitamin C + 3g of fiber.

- **Leafy Greens:** Signature SELECT Chopped Spinach (32oz)
  - **Nutrition:** A source of nitrates, which support Nitric Oxide (NO) production and improve vascular endothelial function; rich in folate and Vitamin K1.
  - **Processing:** Microwaved in the same batch as broccoli or thawed naturally and mixed into hot rice.

- **Antioxidant Fruits:** Signature SELECT Triple Berry Blend (48oz)
  - **Composition:** Blueberries (anthocyanins) + Blackberries (ellagic acid) + Raspberries (raspberry ketones).
  - **Usage:** Eaten directly from frozen (like a sorbet) or thawed for 5 minutes and mixed into oatmeal. Provides polyphenol antioxidants to combat oxidative stress, especially relevant during Seattle's low-light winters.

- **Vegetable Rotation:**
  - **Varieties:** Bell peppers of different colors, kale, asparagus, mushrooms, etc.

*   **Implementation Strategy:** Vegetables are heated in the microwave along with the main course; berries are consumed as a snack or a "sorbet."
*   **System Advantages:**
    *   **Nutrient Lock-in:** "Flash-freezing" technology (IQF) preserves vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals in vegetables and fruits to the greatest extent, making their nutritional value comparable or even superior to "fresh" produce that has undergone long-distance transport and improper storage.
    *   **Efficiency and Convenience:** Eliminates the need for washing and chopping, drastically simplifying the meal prep process and perfectly aligning with the "lazy and efficient" principle.
    *   **Precise Nutrition:** Broccoli (cruciferous) is rich in sulforaphane, spinach is rich in iron, folate, and nitrates, and berries are packed with powerful antioxidants like anthocyanins. The selections are precise and nutrient-dense.

**Monthly Cost:** Broccoli $11.97 + Spinach $11.97 + Berries $14.00 = ~$38
